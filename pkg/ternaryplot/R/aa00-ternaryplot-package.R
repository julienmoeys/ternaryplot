#'Infrastructure for ternary plots, ternary 
#'    classifications and ternary binning (with S3-classes). 
#'    Designed primarily to support the development of soil 
#'    texture plots (soil texture diagrams), but should be 
#'    a useful infrastructure for other ternary plots as well, 
#'    and especially for ternary classifications. Plots fully 
#'    compatible with the graphics-package. 'ternaryplot' 
#'    attempts to respect as much as possible (a) the plot 
#'    layout of the graphics-package, (b) the size and location 
#'    of plot-items such as axis tick marks and (c) the name 
#'    of parameters in the graphics-package. Function names and 
#'    functions arguments are as much as possible similar to 
#'    those in the graphics-package. Several ternary plot 
#'    geometries are supported, but all are based on a single 
#'    triangle with a horizontal base.
