CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.0
    
    2016/01/19  Function ternaryPolygons() created, to add 
        polygons (grids or ternary classes) over an existing 
        ternary plot.
        
        Re-organised the source code.
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3.3
    
    2016/01/12  The package encoding (in DESCRIPTION) has been 
        set to UTF-8.
        
        Now several (more) internal functions uses geometry 
        specific methods (easier to maintain and improve)
        See (in the code) ._ternaryGridBase, ._ternaryTicks, 
        ._ternaryAxisArrowsBase and ._ternaryAxisArrows
        
        ternaryClassification() created. Extract the 
        class-polygons from a ternarySystem-object (if it 
        has classes).
        
        ternaryPlot() can now plot (overlay) grids generated 
        by createTernaryGrid() and ternary classification 
        fetched with ternaryClassification()
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3.2
    
    2016/01/07  ternary2xy() now call internal function 
        .ternary2xy() that uses specific methods for each 
        geometry (TTT, FFF, FTX, TXF), based on the 2nd 
        class-attribute. Makes the code clearer.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3.1

    2016/01/07  Further development. Create a 2nd class in 
        addition to ternaryGeometry for creating 
        geometry-specific methods (instead of complicated
        case specific code).
