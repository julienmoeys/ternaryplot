Title: Infrastructure for ternary plots, ternary classifications and ternary binning (S3-classes)

Description: Infrastructure for ternary plots, ternary
    classifications and ternary binning (with S3-classes).
    Designed primarily to support the development of soil
    texture plots (soil texture diagrams), but should be
    a useful infrastructure for other ternary plots as well,
    and especially for ternary classifications. Plots fully
    compatible with the graphics-package. 'ternaryplot'
    attempts to respect as much as possible (a) the plot
    layout of the graphics-package, (b) the size and location
    of plot-items such as axis tick marks and (c) the name
    of parameters in the graphics-package. Function names and
    functions arguments are as much as possible similar to
    those in the graphics-package. Several ternary plot
    geometries are supported, but all are based on a single
    triangle with a horizontal base.
