Title: Utility functions for soil texture ternary plots and soil texture classification
Author: Julien MOEYS <Julien.Moeys@slu.se>
Maintainer: Julien MOEYS <Julien.Moeys@slu.se>
Description: Set of R functions designed to produce soil texture
    triangles (also called soil texture plots, soil
    texture diagrams or soil texture ternary plots),
    classify and transform soil textures data. These
    functions allows to plot any soil texture triangle
    (classification) into different triangle geometries
    (isosceles, right-angled triangles, etc.). This set
    of function is expected to be useful to people using
    soil textures data from different soil texture
    classification or different particle size systems.
    Many (> 15) texture triangles from all around the
    world will be predefined in the package. 'soiltexture2'
    is a complete redesign and re-documentation of the
    soiltexture-package, from which is keeps the core features.
